**Secure Software Development Lifecycle (S-SDLC)**  
In traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), security testing often came late in the process. Bugs, security flaws, and other vulnerabilities were discovered late, making them expensive and time-consuming to fix. Often, security was overlooked until the testing phase, and many issues were only found by end-users after the product was released. The **Secure SDLC (S-SDLC)** model aims to include security at every stage of development, making security a priority from start to finish.

**Why is Secure SDLC Important?**  
A study by the Systems and Sciences Institute at IBM found that fixing a bug during the implementation stage is six times more expensive than fixing one found during the design phase. If flaws are discovered during testing, it’s 15 times more costly, and up to 100 times more expensive if found during the maintenance phase. Here's why it's better to catch problems early:

- **Faster Development:** By addressing issues early, the development process can move faster.
- **Cost Reduction:** Early detection and resolution of vulnerabilities save money.
- **Lower Business Risk:** Security problems found early reduce the chance of business disruptions and major security breaches.

For example, in traditional waterfall models, security testing was often done at the end, just before production. In more modern, agile approaches, security can be integrated throughout the process, such as reviewing architecture in the design phase, doing code reviews and scans during development, and conducting security tests (like penetration tests) before deployment.  

In a waterfall model, if a security flaw like an **SQL injection** is found during testing, it would require a full redesign and retesting, making it a costly fix. However, in an agile approach, such flaws can be prevented early by addressing them in the planning phase. For example, deciding to use parameterized queries during the planning phase can prevent this issue from arising, saving time and money.

**Summary**  
- Security is an ongoing concern that improves both software quality and security.  
- Increasing security education and awareness ensures everyone understands security requirements at each phase.  
- Finding flaws early helps reduce the risk of cyberattacks or system disruptions.  
- Early detection of vulnerabilities reduces costs, improves speed, and prevents business risks, reputation damage, and fines that could lead to serious financial consequences for a company.

## Implementing SSDLC

**Implementing S-SDLC**  
As discussed in the **Intro to DevSecOps** section, Secure Software Development Lifecycle (S-SDLC) means embedding security practices into every stage of the software development process. This includes using security testing tools and writing security requirements alongside regular functional requirements.

**Understanding Your Security Posture**  
Before you can successfully introduce new security tools or processes, it’s important to understand your current security state. Here’s how you can get started:  
- **Perform a Gap Analysis:** This helps you see what security activities and policies already exist in your organization and how well they work. For example, check if there are security policies in place and if the team follows them properly.
- **Create Software Security Initiatives (SSI):** Set clear and achievable security goals, like creating secure coding standards or setting up playbooks for data handling. These initiatives should have measurable outcomes and be tracked using project management tools.
- **Formalize Security Processes:** Once you start a new security program, spend time making sure engineers understand it and gather feedback before fully enforcing it. This will ensure your security policies and procedures work well.
- **Invest in Security Training:** Make sure your team is trained on new security processes and the tools they'll use. It's best to invest in training before rolling out new tools or processes.

**S-SDLC Processes**  
Once you understand your security posture, it’s time to add security to your SDLC. This involves integrating security steps, such as security testing and risk assessments, into your regular development process. Here are key processes to include:  

- **Risk Assessment:** Early in the SDLC, identify security risks to promote a "security by design" approach. For example, during the planning stage, make sure a user requesting a blog entry on a website cannot change or delete other users' posts.
  
- **Threat Modeling:** This is about identifying potential security threats where there are no safeguards in place. It works well after risk assessment and during the design stage. For example, ensure there is a verification step when users request sensitive information, like account details.

- **Code Scanning / Review:** Manual or automated code reviews should happen during the development stage. These reviews use Static and Dynamic Security Testing technologies to detect vulnerabilities in the code early.

- **Security Assessments:** These include **Penetration Testing** and **Vulnerability Assessments**, which are types of automated testing that find weaknesses in the system. Penetration testing goes further by simulating attacks to check if these vulnerabilities can be exploited. Both are performed in the **Operations & Maintenance** phase after the application prototype is ready.

**Methodologies for Applying Security Processes**  
There are specific methods to apply security processes like risk assessments, threat modeling, code scanning, and penetration testing. These methods will guide you through each phase of the SDLC to ensure security is properly integrated. The next sections will dive deeper into these processes.

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Assessment**

Risk is the chance that a threat could harm a resource or system. For example, if vulnerabilities in software are exploited after a new version is released, or if there are design flaws or poorly reviewed code, these can increase the risk of a security breach. Risk management is a key part of the software development process, helping reduce potential risks to a product or service.

**What is Risk Assessment?**  
Risk assessment is the process of identifying and evaluating potential threats to understand their impact on the system. Once risks are identified, appropriate actions can be taken to reduce or eliminate them. Typically, risk assessment is followed by **threat modeling**, which will be explained further in the next section.


### **How to Perform a Risk Assessment**

1. **Assume the Software Will Be Attacked:**  
   Start by assuming that your software will face attacks. Think about what motivates attackers and the factors that affect the risk level, such as:  
   - The value of the data in the program  
   - The security level of external services the software depends on  
   - The size of the user base (local, small team, or global)  
   
   Based on these factors, you can determine the acceptable level of risk. For example, if data loss could cost millions, but fixing a security flaw might cost $40,000, the company must decide whether it's worth spending the money to fix the flaw. Additionally, brand reputation is a big consideration—damage to the company’s reputation could cost more in the long run than fixing the bug.

2. **Risk Evaluation:**  
   The next step is to evaluate the risks. Think about the worst-case scenario if an attacker successfully breaches the software. You can show these scenarios to decision-makers by simulating attacks, such as a ransomware attack.  
   Key things to consider during evaluation:  
   - The value of the data being targeted, like user identities or credentials  
   - The complexity of the attack (how hard it is for the attacker to carry out)  
   - The number of people affected (e.g., one user versus thousands of users)  
   - The difficulty of access (is the system exposed to the public internet or only accessible locally?)
   
   If an attacker can exploit a vulnerability easily, the risk is high, and it should be addressed.

3. **Assess the Impact:**  
   Consider how the attack will affect different users and systems. For example, a denial-of-service attack could affect thousands of users if a server is targeted, or it could infect many computers with worms. Also, evaluate if the system is exposed to the public (e.g., the internet) or if it requires special access (e.g., authentication) to connect. The higher the accessibility and the larger the potential impact, the higher the risk.


### **Types of Risk Assessments**

There are different ways to assess risks, and the best method depends on the situation. Below are the two most common types of risk assessments:

1. **Qualitative Risk Assessment:**  
   This is the most common type of risk assessment in companies. In a qualitative assessment, risks are classified into categories such as "Low", "Medium", or "High." This approach looks at the potential harm and the likelihood of it happening. The goal is to decide what actions to take to reduce or control the risks. A simple way to calculate qualitative risk is:  
   **Risk = Severity x Likelihood**  
   - **Severity** is the impact of the problem.  
   - **Likelihood** is the chance of the problem occurring.  
   It’s up to the assessor to judge how serious each factor is.
   
   "Severity" is the impact of the consequence, and Likelihood is the probability of it happening. It is up to the risk assessor to judge these circumstances.
   

2. **Quantitative Risk Assessment:**  
   Quantitative risk assessment uses numbers to measure risk. Instead of "Low", "Medium", and "High," numerical values are used to represent risk levels. Tools or formulas are used to calculate the **Severity** and **Likelihood**. For example, if a bug affects a critical service, like an authentication service, you might assign a high number (e.g., 5 points) to show how serious it is. This approach helps measure risk in a more precise way and can be customized to the company’s needs and processes.

## Threat Modelling

**Threat Modelling**

Threat modelling is best done early in the design phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), before any code is written. It’s a structured way to identify potential security threats and find ways to protect valuable or high-risk data, such as confidential information. The earlier it’s done, the better, as it helps catch potential problems early and reduces the cost of fixing them later.

There are several methods to perform threat modelling, each with a slightly different focus. Some methods look more at risks, others focus on privacy or customer concerns. The key is to choose the method that best fits the project or business. Popular threat modelling methods include STRIDE, DREAD, and PASTA.

### **STRIDE**
---
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd467e4d-a486-4ea6-9c18-bccc7e082b4a)

---
STRIDE is a widely used threat modelling method created by Microsoft. It focuses on six types of threats:

- **Spoofing**: When an attacker impersonates a user or system. This violates the **Authentication** principle (part of the CIA Triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Examples include IP or DNS spoofing.
  
- **Tampering**: When unauthorized changes are made to data. This violates the **Integrity** principle of the CIA Triad.
  
- **Repudiation**: When an attacker denies their actions or alters logs, making it hard to trace their actions. This violates **Non-repudiation** (the idea that actions can be traced back to their origin).
  
- **Information Disclosure**: When sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized parties, violating the **Confidentiality** principle of the CIA Triad. This includes data breaches.

- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: When a legitimate user can’t access a service due to it being overwhelmed with traffic or other attacks, violating the **Availability** principle of the CIA Triad.

- **Elevation of Privilege**: When an attacker gains higher access rights than they are supposed to have, violating the **Authorization** principle of the CIA Triad.

To use STRIDE, security professionals typically create a data flow diagram (DFD) to understand the system’s structure and identify potential threats. STRIDE focuses on answering the question: "What could go wrong with this system?"

### **DREAD**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0377fcd7-16ae-454c-9732-8986f829af37)

DREAD is another model from Microsoft that is often used in combination with STRIDE. DREAD helps rank threats based on their severity. It uses five factors to score each threat:

- **Damage**: The potential damage a threat could cause to the system or data. For example, a score of 0 means no damage, while a score of 10 means critical service loss.
  
- **Reproducibility**: How easy it is for an attacker to repeat the attack. A score of 0 means it's very hard to replicate, while a score of 10 means it's very easy.

- **Exploitability**: How easy it is for an attacker to launch the attack. A score of 0 means advanced skills are needed, while a score of 10 means a simple tool is enough.

- **Affected Users**: The number of people who would be impacted if the threat were successful. A score of 0 means no users are affected, while a score of 10 means all users are affected.

- **Discoverability**: How easy it is to find the vulnerability. A score of 0 means it’s hard to detect, while a score of 10 means it’s easy to spot, like a public-facing issue.

Each of these factors is rated on a scale (usually from 0 to 10), and the scores help prioritize which threats need attention first.

### **PASTA**
---
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fd5256a-98fc-41b9-848c-b3ce7354516a)
---
PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is a risk-focused framework that helps align technical requirements with business objectives. It looks at threats from an attacker’s perspective and helps identify vulnerabilities and mitigate them strategically. PASTA consists of seven stages:

1. **Define Objectives**: Set clear goals for what the system needs to protect and identify critical assets that need to be secured.

2. **Define Technical Scope**: Create diagrams of the system architecture, both logical and physical, to help map out potential attack surfaces and dependencies.

3. **Decomposition & Analysis**: Identify the system’s components and map out the “trust boundaries” where attacks might occur (e.g., libraries, modules, or services).

4. **Threat Analysis**: Use threat intelligence to find out which applications or components are vulnerable to specific attacks (e.g., DDOS, data alteration).

5. **Vulnerabilities & Weaknesses Analysis**: Assess the security flaws in the application and recommend fixes. This is where lessons learned from past incidents can be useful.

6. **Attack/Exploit Enumeration & Modelling**: Map out all the potential attack paths, including how an attacker might exploit the vulnerabilities and where to focus defense efforts.

7. **Risk Impact Analysis**: Finally, analyze the risks based on the information gathered and document the recommended steps to mitigate or eliminate any remaining risks.


By using these threat modelling techniques—STRIDE, DREAD, or PASTA—developers and security professionals can identify and address potential vulnerabilities early in the design phase. This proactive approach helps protect valuable data, reduces the chances of a successful attack, and minimizes the cost of fixing issues later in the development process.

## Secure Code Review & Analysis

---
### Secure Code Review & Analysis

Research by Verizon in 2020 found that 43% of data breaches were caused by attacks on web applications, with many other breaches linked to vulnerabilities in web applications. To help prevent such issues, it's essential to integrate secure code review into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), especially during the implementation phase. Doing so strengthens the security of the product and reduces future costs associated with patching vulnerabilities.

A **secure code review** is the process of checking the code to identify and fix security weaknesses. This helps prevent vulnerabilities and flaws from being released into production. By having developers regularly review their code, the team can catch problems early and respond faster. Code reviews are crucial because they avoid delays in the release and help avoid exposing users to security risks. Implementing secure code reviews can also ensure that the company meets compliance standards set by government bodies and certifications.

---
There are two main types of code reviews: **manual** and **automated**.

- **Manual Code Review**: An expert reviews the code line by line to identify any vulnerabilities. This requires clear communication between the expert and the developers to understand the code’s purpose. After the review, the expert reports any issues back to the developers, who can then fix them.

- **Automated Code Review**: Tools automatically check the code for vulnerabilities. These tools can be set up to run regularly, providing quick feedback to the development team.

### Code Analysis

There are two main approaches to code analysis: **static analysis** and **dynamic analysis**.

- **Static Analysis**: This examines the source code without running the program. It detects errors and vulnerabilities at the code level before the program is executed.
  
- **Dynamic Analysis**: This looks at the code while the program is running. It helps identify errors and vulnerabilities that appear during the program's execution.

#### **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**

**SAST** is a white-box testing method that checks the source code before it’s compiled or executed. It looks for vulnerabilities in the code itself, even before the application is live.

- **Why is it called Static?**: It tests the code before the application is running, allowing you to find problems before they become part of the running system.

- **How Does SAST Work?**: SAST scans the source code to find vulnerabilities. Once a vulnerability is found, the developers fix it before the code is compiled and deployed. This method is called **White Box Testing** because it allows testers to look inside the application’s structure and behavior.

- **Bonus: SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**: SCA works alongside SAST to scan dependencies, like open-source libraries, for vulnerabilities. Modern applications often rely on open-source components, so using SCA helps ensure these components are secure.

#### **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**

**DAST** is a black-box testing method that identifies vulnerabilities while the application is running, typically in a production or testing environment. It simulates attacks on the live application to find potential vulnerabilities.

- **How Does DAST Work?**: DAST tools act like attackers and test how the application behaves during an attack. They don't have access to the source code, so they test vulnerabilities from an external perspective.

- **Why Use DAST?**: DAST helps detect runtime vulnerabilities that can only be found when the application is actively running. It is often used in the testing or pre-production stages of the SDLC.

#### **IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)**

**IAST** is a tool that runs alongside the application to monitor and analyze it for security issues while it’s running. It uses a **Grey Box Testing** approach, combining aspects of both SAST and DAST.

- **How Does IAST Work?**: IAST runs in real-time during the application’s execution in the staging or testing environment. It can identify specific lines of code that cause security issues, providing more detailed feedback than SAST or DAST alone. IAST also integrates with the application server to monitor all traffic and data patterns, helping catch security issues as they happen.

- **Benefits**: IAST provides more accurate and detailed reports on vulnerabilities, allowing developers to fix issues quickly during testing.

- **Bonus: RASP (Runtime Application Self Protection)**: RASP is a tool that works in real-time to monitor and protect an application while it’s running. It analyzes incoming and outgoing traffic, as well as user behavior, to block attacks before they cause harm. Unlike other tools, RASP is used after the application is live, providing protection against attacks that may have bypassed earlier security measures.

---

### Choosing the Right Tools

SAST, DAST, and IAST each have strengths that complement each other:

- **SAST** is best for identifying vulnerabilities early in the development process, before the code is even compiled.
  
- **DAST** focuses on runtime issues, testing the application while it's running to see how it behaves under attack.

- **IAST** bridges the gap between SAST and DAST by analyzing the application as it runs and providing more detailed feedback on security vulnerabilities.

Together, these tools provide a comprehensive approach to application security, enabling **DevSecOps** teams to continuously test, monitor, and fix vulnerabilities as the software is developed and deployed.

### **Timeline of Application Security Automation**

Here’s when you should implement each of these security tools in the SDLC:

- **SAST** can be used early in development because it doesn’t require the application to be running. It’s great for finding vulnerabilities before the code is live.

- **SCA** works well for identifying open-source components and their associated security risks, especially from a licensing perspective.

- **DAST** is best used during the testing phase or pre-production stage when the application is running in a controlled environment.

- **IAST** is typically deployed in the staging or testing environment, where it can monitor the application as it runs and find vulnerabilities.

- **RASP** is used in the production environment to continuously monitor and protect the application during runtime.

By integrating these tools throughout the SDLC, you can ensure your application remains secure from development to deployment and beyond.


## Security Assessment

### Security Assessment

A **security assessment** is an important part of ensuring security in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It should be done during every phase of development, if possible. A security assessment checks a system, software, or web application for vulnerabilities and potential attack points. These assessments are usually carried out at the end of the SDLC, during the **Operations and Maintenance** phase, once all components and updates are integrated into the system.

There are two main types of security assessments:

1. **Vulnerability Assessment**
2. **Penetration Testing**

These assessments often involve external security experts who are hired to test and attempt to break into the company’s network or systems in a controlled, legal way.

---

### Vulnerability Assessment

A **Vulnerability Assessment** focuses on **finding vulnerabilities** in a system but does not go deeper into testing whether those vulnerabilities can actually be exploited in real-life situations. It uses automated tools to scan the organization's network and systems for weaknesses.

- **Tools Used**: Some common tools for vulnerability assessments are OpenVAS, Nessus (Tenable), and ISS Scanner. These tools scan ports and services on systems across different IP addresses and check for known vulnerabilities.
- **How It Works**: The tool compares service versions to a database of known vulnerabilities. The output is usually a list of vulnerabilities, categorized by their severity (e.g., High, Medium, Low) or given a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score.

While a vulnerability assessment can quickly identify potential weaknesses, it doesn't simulate attacks or confirm whether a vulnerability can actually be exploited.

---

### Penetration Testing

**Penetration Testing** is more detailed than a vulnerability assessment. It includes **vulnerability testing** but goes deeper by actually **testing and validating** whether vulnerabilities can be exploited. It attempts to **penetrate systems** to see how an attacker could use those vulnerabilities to cause harm.

- **What Happens During Pen Testing**: The tester will try to exploit a vulnerability (like escalating privileges) to understand the potential damage. Even a low-risk vulnerability might be used to launch a more severe attack. 
- **Outcome**: After testing, the security expert provides a detailed report outlining the vulnerabilities found, the risks they pose, and recommendations for how to fix them. For example, they might show how an attacker could recover an employee's password by exploiting a vulnerability.

Pen testing helps businesses understand how an attacker could use vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios.

---

### Pros and Cons

#### Vulnerability Assessment

- **Pros**:
  - **Quick identification** of potential vulnerabilities.
  - **Cheaper** than penetration testing.
  - **Part of penetration testing**: It helps identify vulnerabilities that might be further tested in a penetration test.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Can produce a **large number of reports**, which may be overwhelming.
  - **Quality depends on the tool** used: Some tools may not catch all vulnerabilities.
  - Does not simulate **real-life attack scenarios** (like exploiting a vulnerability behind a firewall or using social engineering).
  - Low-risk vulnerabilities might be used in combination to cause greater damage.

#### Penetration Testing

- **Pros**:
  - Shows organizations **how an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities**.
  - Provides a **real risk analysis**, helping businesses understand how dangerous each vulnerability is.
  - Can be demonstrated to **customers** to show the organization is actively working to secure their systems.

- **Cons**:
  - **Expensive** due to the time and resources required.
  - Requires significant **planning** and coordination to carry out the tests effectively.
  
---

Both **Vulnerability Assessments** and **Penetration Testing** play a vital role in identifying security weaknesses, but they serve different purposes. Vulnerability assessments are quicker and cheaper, while penetration testing provides a deeper and more realistic view of how vulnerabilities can be exploited in real-world attacks.


## SSDLC Methodologies

---
### SSDLC Methodologies

There are different ways to add security to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). No matter which development method you choose (Agile, DevOps, Waterfall, etc.), you should always:

- **Build security into the design from the start**.
- **Test for security regularly**.

Here are some of the widely used security-focused SDLC methodologies:

- **Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)**
- **OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle (S-SDLC)**
- **Software Security Touchpoints**

---

### Microsoft’s SDL

**Microsoft’s SDL** is a set of security practices and activities that should be followed during each phase of the SDLC. The SDL focuses on creating secure software by addressing potential security issues early and throughout the process.

**Key SDL Principles:**
1. **Secure by Design**: Security is built into the software from the very beginning.
2. **Security by Default**: Systems are designed to reduce the risk of harm, e.g., software is set up with the least privileges needed.
3. **Secure in Deployment**: Deployment includes tools and guidance to help administrators keep the software secure.
4. **Communication**: Developers communicate openly about potential threats to ensure everyone is prepared.

The SDL includes mandatory security activities tied to different stages of the software lifecycle. It uses data to track the effectiveness of training and process compliance. It also uses metrics to improve security practices over time. 

### SDL Practices and Why They Matter

1. **Provide Training**: Developers and product managers need to understand security basics so they can build secure software while meeting business goals.
2. **Define Security Requirements**: Regularly update security and privacy requirements based on new functionality and changing threats.
3. **Define Metrics and Compliance**: Set clear security goals to ensure the team meets security standards during development.
4. **Perform Threat Modeling**: Identify potential security risks by examining how the system will work in real life and discussing design risks.
5. **Establish Design Requirements**: Ensure that security features, like cryptography and authentication, are well-engineered and applied consistently.
6. **Use Cryptography Standards**: Protect sensitive data during storage or transmission using encryption.
7. **Manage Third-Party Risks**: Keep track of third-party components and be prepared for any vulnerabilities that may arise from them.
8. **Use Approved Tools**: Stick to using trusted, up-to-date tools that offer security checks.
9. **Perform Security Testing**: Use automated tools like SAST, DAST, and IAST to check for security flaws in the code and during runtime.
10. **Perform Security Assessments**: Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to find and fix security weaknesses.
11. **Incident Response Plan**: Prepare a clear plan for dealing with security incidents, including who to contact and how to handle security threats.

---

### OWASP’s S-SDLC

**OWASP’s Secure Software Development Lifecycle (S-SDLC)** focuses on building secure software through an Agile approach. The goal is to integrate security at every step in the development process by setting "security quality gates." These gates help ensure security is part of every sprint.

**Key Features of OWASP S-SDLC:**
- **Agile Security Approach**: Sprints are dedicated to specific security tasks, such as code reviews, input validation, and risk assessments.
- **Security Maturity Models**: OWASP uses the **Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)** to help organizations evaluate and improve their security practices. SAMM is a framework for building a strong software security program tailored to an organization’s specific risks. It helps measure progress and identify areas for improvement.
- **BSIMM (Building Security in Maturity Model)**: BSIMM looks at real-world security practices from other organizations. It doesn’t tell you what to do but shows how others approach security and helps you understand where your organization stands compared to others.

**How SAMM and BSIMM Help:**
- **SAMM**: Offers a way to assess how well your security practices are working and helps you set goals for improvement.
- **BSIMM**: Compares your security practices to those of other organizations to help you understand your security posture and where you can improve.

By following these models, organizations can improve their software security practices over time, ensuring better protection against potential threats.

--- 

### Conclusion

The key to integrating security into the SDLC is to always focus on security, from the design phase all the way through to deployment. Whether using Microsoft's SDL or OWASP’s S-SDLC, adopting clear security practices and tools ensures that software is built securely and stays secure through every phase of development.
